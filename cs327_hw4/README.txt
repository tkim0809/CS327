I first created a method to generate some water element on the map with low possibility.
I created a typedef struct of characters that help with the method which gives characters location direction, etc.
I then moved on the move methods for every trainers, and then a method for creating trainers randomly. 
I also had to create a map that stores the trainers so I modified some of printmap function too.
You can change the numoftrainers in the int main() manually to run however you like.
