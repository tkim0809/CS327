I started to work on the assignment with the code given by professor.
I first tried to understand his code, specifically his dijkstra algorithm, by going to online websites or youtubes.
I then worked on generating a pc character on a map randomly.
Then I moved on to the dijkstra algorithm and method that calculates weights for different trainers.
