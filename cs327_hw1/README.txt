Started this assignment with creating an empty [21][80] grid first.
Worked to created a boulder first on the edge of the map.
Had to come up with an algorithm to find a way to make the seed "grow", I made the method to grow in square shaped.
When I was able to come up with an algorithm to randomly generate every elements, I applied this algorithm to make every elements method.
Then, I worked on to create a path after the map was fully filled.
After the path was created, I created a method to fill the empty spots. First started with 100 fill numbers but then I didn't see the changes so I changed to 200 fill numbers with some added random number.
