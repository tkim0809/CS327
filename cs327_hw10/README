I made a simple airplane shooting game.
You get to choose which airplane you like to play with on the beginning of the game.
After you choose which airplane you like to play with, you can choose the difficulty from easy, medium to hard (difficulty is based on the enemy airplane's bullets frequency).



Game controls are:
'q': to shoot bullet.
'w': to use special move/ultimate.
     Special move/ultimate is following:

     "Skybolt": Shoots bullets in a spread pattern by shooting 5 bullets at once.
     "Thunderbolt": Temporarily increases bullet speed(currently set for five seconds)
     "Fireball": Fires homing bullets that track the enemy.

Arrow-up and Arrow-down to move up and down.




To run the game:
cd or direct to the file that contains the game file, and "make" on terminal.
Then ./airplane_battle to run.
