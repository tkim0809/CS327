I started this assignment with watching on internet what knights tours are.
I first created a validMove method, which gives false value if the given x and y values are out of the chess board (negative values or values that are greater than a grid), true otherwise.
Then, I used recursive method to find all the solutions. It is meant to print the values whenever the
number count is up to 25(because 5*5 = 25). And then resetting the board to new again. After that, finds the other solutions using recursions with new coordinates values.
I really tried to make the makefile but I wasn't able to figure it out in time.
