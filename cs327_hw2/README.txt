I started to work on the assignment with the code given by professor.
I first tried to read and understand the code but then I figured that I had little knowledge of struct and pointers of C language.
Went on to Youtube and google to learn stuff.
After that, I worked on to write a code.
Initialized the [401][401] map to NULL except the center map.
Came up with an idea to use n,s,e,w to use it as the new position of gates to new maps.
