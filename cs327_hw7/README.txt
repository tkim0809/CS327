Started project with professor's code. I had trouble getting into ssh server at first, it was giving me a permission error but somehow it fixed itself so i was able to downloaded the data files. I had to learn how to work with the files in c++ to parse and print. 

To run the program, type "make" and then type the file name you want to display. 
For example, for moves.csv you can just type moves and the data will show on the screen.
Made it so that whenever you type 'q' the program quits.

** I haven't tested my code on the pyrite because it was giving me a permission error again when I tried to test my code, but im pretty sure my code will run perfectly fine because I have tested out on my computer with the local copy files.
